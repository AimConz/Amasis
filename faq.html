        <p><b>Why do you farm until 1-2K?</b></p>
        <p>The reason is that Roblox bans games with 11 players and low visits!</p>

        <p><b>Why do you ask to bypass 11 players?</b></p>
        <p>Because Roblox bans every game that reaches more than 11 players.</p>

        <p><b>Where can I buy ranks/private games?</b></p>
        <p>Go to the main menu and click "Shop".</p>
